      <h2 id="center">Peaky Blinders</h2>
      <P>Tommy Shelby is the main character of the series and is played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy.
         He heads the Shelby family and he is the leader of the Peaky Blinders. 
         Tommy is cool, calculating and ruthless, but also charming and loyal. 
         He does everything he can to improve his own position and his family's power. 
         Along with his brothers, he served during the war. 
         This traumatic experience changed him forever.

          <h2 id="center">The criminality of the Peaky Blinders</h2>
          <p>The Peaky Blinders begin as a criminal gang engaged in theft, extortion and illegal gambling. As the series progresses, the Peaky Blinders' various practices increase. Eventually, they grow into a powerful organisation that makes money in various legal and less legal ways. At the end of season 1, for instance, the Peaky Blinders gain full control over legal betting shops in horse racing. This turns out to be the first step towards a more legal way of operating for the Shelby's. Trading horses and horse racing is more than a revenue model for Tommy. Besides Grace, he has two other great loves: horses and cars.

In the search for legal ways to make money, Tommy sets up the family business Shelby Company Limited. This company engages in various practices throughout the series. These include distilling and exporting gin and other alcoholic drinks, manufacturing cars and car parts, and transporting various goods for the British government. So although Shelby Company Limited is a legal and profitable business, it is also used to launder money obtained illegally. In this way, the Peaky Blinders manage to build a prosperous business empire through which they gain international prestige.
